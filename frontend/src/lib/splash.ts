/**
 * The cover that holds the screen while the app gets on its feet.
 *
 * Frappe shows one on every desk navigation; crossing between the desk and
 * this app is a full document load in both directions, and without a cover
 * that crossing is a flash of half-painted page. The markup and the styling
 * live in `www/livestock_app.html` so the cover is on screen in the first
 * frame, before this bundle — or its stylesheet — has loaded. This module only
 * decides when it comes down.
 *
 * Coming IN is the only direction that needs one. Leaving for the desk raises
 * Frappe's own splash the moment /app starts loading, and two covers handing
 * over to each other is one more than the crossing needs.
 *
 * WHEN IT COMES DOWN. Three conditions, in order:
 *
 *  1. React has painted. Uncovering a root React has been handed but not yet
 *     drawn shows the blank frame the cover exists to hide.
 *  2. A second has passed. A cover that flashes off after thirty milliseconds
 *     is a flicker, not a transition — it reads as a glitch rather than as the
 *     app opening.
 *  3. The first data has landed. Every endpoint goes through `call` in
 *     lib/frappe, so the count of requests in flight is known here without a
 *     single page having to say anything; the cover waits for that count to
 *     reach zero rather than handing over a screen of empty figures.
 *
 * And a cap, because condition 3 is a promise this module cannot keep on its
 * own: an endpoint that hangs would otherwise trap the operator behind a logo
 * with no way past it. At the cap the cover comes down regardless and the page
 * shows whatever state it is in — which is at worst the same empty screen,
 * with the controls to do something about it.
