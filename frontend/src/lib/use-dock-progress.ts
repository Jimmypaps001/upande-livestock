 * How far a heading is through handing itself over to the dock: 0 while it is

 *
 * A NUMBER, NOT A BOOLEAN, and that is the whole point. A boolean can only
 * make one thing appear as another disappears, which is two events that happen
 * to be adjacent; the eye reads it as a flicker and, in the window where both
 * are drawn, as a duplicate. One progress value drives the heading out and the
 * pill in together, so what the eye sees is a single piece of text moving.
 *
 * Read off getBoundingClientRect rather than scrollY: the heading is not
 * always at the top of the document — a notice or an error banner above it
 * shifts everything down — and its own position on screen is the thing that
 * actually decides when it has gone.
 *
 * Sampled on a frame, not on the scroll event. Scroll fires far faster than
 * the screen repaints, and the answer is only ever used to paint.
 *
 * LISTENED FOR IN THE CAPTURE PHASE, ON THE DOCUMENT. The served page puts
 * `overflow: hidden` on the body and makes #livestock-root the scroller, so
 * the window never scrolls and a listener on it never fires — which is exactly
 * how this shipped doing nothing at all. Scroll events do not bubble, but they
 * do capture, so one listener on the document catches the scroll whatever
 * element is doing it and this cannot break again if the shell changes.
