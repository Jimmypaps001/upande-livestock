/**
 * The page's name, after it has finished travelling out of the page.
 *
 * Driven by the same progress value that fades the heading, so the two are one
 * movement rather than two: the pill starts small and a little high, at the
 * size and place the heading is leaving from, and settles into the dock as the
 * heading goes. Nothing appears while something else is still there.
 *
 * The scale runs from 0.86 to 1 rather than from the heading's real ratio. A
 * 40px title shrinking to 14px is a 3× collapse, and at that ratio the text
 * spends most of the movement illegibly small and arrives with a snap; the
 * shorter range reads as the same gesture and stays readable throughout.
 *
 * The TRANSFORM runs across the whole handover and the OPACITY only across its
 * second half. Motion is what makes it read as one title travelling; a shared
 * fade is what made it read as two.
