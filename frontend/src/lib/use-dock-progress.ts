 * to be adjacent; the eye reads it as a flicker and, in the window where both
 * are drawn, as a duplicate. One progress value drives the heading out and the
 * pill in together, so what the eye sees is a single piece of text moving.
 *
 * Read off getBoundingClientRect rather than scrollY: the heading is not
 * always at the top of the document — a notice or an error banner above it
 * shifts everything down — and its own position on screen is the thing that
 * actually decides when it has gone.
 *
 * Sampled on a frame, not on the scroll event. Scroll fires far faster than
 * the screen repaints, and the answer is only ever used to paint.
